        <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
        <p>You may receive a Restricted File Type warning message when attempting to upload a file via the Link Control to a module. This message is displayed when you attempt to upload a file with an extension that you are not enabled to upload such as a movie or a sound file. E.g. .avi, .wma. </p>
        <p>Contact a SuperUser to request that the&#160;file types you want to upload are permitted. <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Using the Control Panel/Host Console/Host Settings/Other Settings/Managing Allowable File Extensions.html" MadCap:conditions="Default.SuperUser Only">See "Managing Allowable File Extensions"</MadCap:xref></p>
