        <p>Here are the options to fix this problem:</p>
        <p><b>Option One: Using the Selected File</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can choose to use the file you have already selected, however the document will only be displayed to users with the correct permissions to browse or view the file.</p>

            <li>If you are editing a document, click the <b>Update</b> button. This link isn't displayed when adding a document.</li>
            <li>Click the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update Anyway</span> link.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>Note 1: The warning message continues to display on the Edit Documents page.</p>
        <p>Note 2: You will no longer need to confirm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update Anyway</span> for this document.</p>
        <p><b>Option Two: Modifying the File Location</b>
