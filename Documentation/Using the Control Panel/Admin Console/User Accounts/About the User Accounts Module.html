        <h1>About User Accounts</h1>
        <p>User Accounts  enables the creation and management of registered user accounts, as well as assignment of security roles. The fields displayed on the module can be set, as well as the way user accounts are handled. New profile properties can be created. User Accounts is displayed on the Admin &gt; User Accounts page and
can also be deployed to any page by an authorized user.</p>
        <p>Note: User Accounts forms part of the Users &amp; Roles module package which is set as a Premium Module by default to reduce the instance of it being accidentally added to a page and revealing personal user information.</p>
