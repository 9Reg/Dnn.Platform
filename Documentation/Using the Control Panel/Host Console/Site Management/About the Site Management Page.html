        <h1>About Site Management</h1>
        <p>The Site Management page (Host &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/SiteSettings_16X16_Standard.png" /> Site Management) allows SuperUsers to create and maintain all sites within this DNN installation and generate highly customized template from existing sites that can then be applied to other sites or used to create new sites.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Site Management displays a list of all existing sites including the following details of each:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Site Id</b>: The unique number of this site for this site. The ID of first site created is 0 (zero).</li>
            <li><b>Site Title</b>: The Title of the site as set on the Admin &gt; Site Settings page.</li>
            <li><b>Site Aliases</b>: The http aliases for the site.</li>
            <li><b>Users</b>: The number of Registered Users for the site.</li>
            <li><b>Disk Space</b>: The amount of space in Megabytes (MB) allocated to the site.</li>
            <li><b>Hosting Fee</b>: The monthly fee set for the site.</li>
            <li><b>Expires</b>: The date when hosting for this site is set to expire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What is the difference between a parent and child site?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A parent site is associated with a unique URL (i.e. http://www.domain.com). This generally involves purchasing a Domain Name from an Internet Registrar, setting the Primary/Secondary DNS entries to point to the Hosting Providers DNS Server, and having your Hosting Provider map the Domain Name to the IP Address of your account. You can also use the IP Address of your site without a Domain Name (i.e. 65.174.86.217). If you need to have multiple Domain Names pointing to the same site then you can add multiple aliases in the site edit interface. Do not create a Parent Site until all of the DNS mappings are in place or else you will not be able to access your site.</li>
            <li>A child site is a subhost of your Hosting Provider account. This means a  directory is created on the web server which allows the site to be accessed  through a URL address which includes a Parent domain name as well as the  directory name (I.e. www.domain.com/directory). A child site can be converted  into a Parent Site at any time by simply modifying the Site Alias  entry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Sites are created using the default setting as defined on the Host Settings module such as hosting fee, hosting space and site log history. Once a site has been created, these properties can be modified for individual sites.</p>
