        <h1>About Host Extensions</h1>
        <p>The   Extensions page  (Host &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/Extensions_16x16_Standard.png" /> Extensions) enables SuperUsers to purchase, install and manage extensions, as well as allocate extensions to other sites. Note: This section of the manual only covers tasks that can be performed by SuperUsers. <MadCap:xref href="../../Admin Console/Extensions/About the Admin Extensions Module.html">See "About the Admin Extensions Module"</MadCap:xref> for information on using the Admin Extension module. </p>
        <p><b>Important.</b> The Extensions module located on the Host page is a different module to the one located beneath the Admin page, therefore SuperUsers must use the Host Extensions module to perform Host level tasks such as purchasing extensions.</p>
